<p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer known for big-picture thinking and creative problem solving. I am experienced in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and React, and have a background in leadership within diverse industries. I am known for my strong skills in leadership and communication. My ability to remain calm and composed is an asset when faced with difficult issues. I am a recent graduate of The Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Developer program. I made my career change through a desire for a more creative career and a better work-life balance; 15 years ago, my wife and I moved from New York City to the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  We have an almost 3-year-old daughter and love getting outside, whether it’s hiking, stand-up paddleboarding, biking or skiing.  We’ve also enjoyed traveling (and hiking) in places like South Korea, Scotland, Italy, Norway and London. I am currently seeking a junior software developer position, ideally remote.</p>
